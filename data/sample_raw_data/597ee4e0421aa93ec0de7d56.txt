The skyrocketing rents of Silicon Valley have caused a Facebook employee to live in her car. The woman, named Parsha, who is a third party contractor with the social media giant, has been living in that condition for the past three months, starting from April this year.

The case has thrown light on the parallels of high rent problem in USA's technology hub along with companies' indifferent attitude towards adequate employee salaries.

Multiple media reports say that the average rent for a one-bedroom in Silicon Valley puts people back by a whopping USD 2,300.

Parsha says, as per a report in DailyMail, that she had decided to make her situation public as she felt it was time a dialogue was started about the need for fair compensation so that people can at least pay those exorbitantly high rates.

Facebook has said that it is aware of the high cost of living issues that employees in the Silicon Valley face and added that they are working on the issue to fix it.

In an interview to a US television channel, Parsha said that the rents in northern California neighbourhood are presently way beyond her means.

A hovering average rent of USD 2,300 per month, student loans and medical bills combined have forced her to live out of her car despite being employed with one of the richest technology majors in the world.

Parsha also told DailyMail that she was embarrassed to tell her colleagues about her situation in fear of being shunned and looked down upon.

Parsha happens to be mother of two and also runs her own non-profit organisation called ‘Love n Me” that is dedicated to helping women and girls get back on their feet to pursue a successful, fulfilling life,” according to a statement on the organisation’s website.

The case raises questions of the standard of salaries high-end companies are paying their employees and whether it is enough for survival in the expensive neighborhood.
