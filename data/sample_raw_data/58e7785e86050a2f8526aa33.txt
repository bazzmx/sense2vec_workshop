JSW Steel is writing off Rs 5250.88 crore loans given to US-based holding company JSW Steel Holding USA with the intention of liquidating it, as the steelmaker looks to restructure its loss-making overseas subsidiaries.

The liquidation will result in equity and preferential capital reduction in Netherlands Co, which is a holding company for JSW Steel's subsidiaries based in the US, the UK, Chile and East Africa, said JSW Steel said in a regulatory filing with BSE. Netherlands Co also has a 49% equity holding of Georgia-based Geo Steel.

JSW Steel had already made a provision of Rs 6208.74 crore for the loans given to the US-holding company in books of accounts in earlier years, it said.

Certain assets and liabilities of JSW Steel Holding USA, which currently holds JSW Steel's pipe and plate mill operations in the country, will be transferred to another US subsidiary Periama Holdings.

“There are too many companies in the US. We are bringing all the assets under one umbrella -Periama Holdings -to make the structure simpler. It will help reduce administrative costs and time,“ said JSW Steel Group CFO Seshagiri Rao, adding that from now on, Periama Holdings will parent all US assets -seven coal mines and the plate and pipe mill.
