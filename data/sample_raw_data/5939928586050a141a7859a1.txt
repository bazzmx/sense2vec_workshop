Whether it's two bicycle repairmen from North Carolina creating a flying machine or an enterprising scientist from Washington building an artificial heart, the beauty of inventions is they can come from pretty much anywhere.

Faculty at MidAmerica Nazarene University decided to see which inventions best represented each state.

Going back to the late 18th century, the inventions range from blue jeans to the iPhone. They were picked based on the impact they've left on society, the economy, or science.

These inventions won't soon be forgotten.
