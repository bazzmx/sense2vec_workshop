Talking to ET Now Chief Statistician of India & Secretary atsays in 2014-15, there was a major international price crash in commodity prices and that led to a negative growth in WPI from that period onwards for almost 14 to 15 months.Edited excerpts:The fourth quarter growth is a reflection of a number of processes and policies which were taken in this period. It is not possible for me to enunciate all of them but let me indicate some of the processes which are underway. First of all, part of the quarterly structure is because of revision of IIP. While IIP and WPI have not played a big role in the annual estimates, in the quarterly structure they have played a role and if you look at the new IIP series, you will see a trend of slowdown from the first quarter which the GDP compilation also reveals that is part one.The second observation is with regard to price movements and this is in both the old and new series of WPI. The basic phenomenon is that in 2014-15, we saw a major international price crash in commodity prices and that led to a negative growth in WPI from that period onwards for almost a period of 14 to 15 months.The natural consequence of that is that once the commodity price had reached bottom and started hardening and rising again, the WPI also left negative territory and enter into positive domain. If you look at the movement of WPI over the last almost 12 quarters or so, it is in negative territory till the first quarter of this year and then start becoming positive.In fact, in the fourth quarter we get a very high WPI reflecting a base effect from a low value from the previous year to near normal levels in the current year.A consequence of this long run trajectory of prices shows up in constant price GDP estimates by slightly higher numbers in the fourth quarter last year and a corresponding lower number this year. These are the trends which are also built into the pattern of numbers which we see from the last five to six quarters in interpreting the data.One will have to be very careful about allocation exercises for which at the moment a long time series is not available on both the side of the demonetisation event.As far as that is concerned, that series is already available till our third quarter release. In general, once a data series is revised, it is not desirable or acceptable to make comparisons based on the two.However, GDP data is available in disaggregation. The IIP and WPI data on old and new series is also available until the month of March.Anybody who wishes to try to make the analysis is welcome to do so. The reason why we do not do so is it is meaningless to say what would it have been had this been the case or that been the case. That is not what GDP compilations are about. These types of things are left best to academic papers and journals rather than a serious analysis of what reality is about because the number of assumptions which go into making these compilations do not make it desirable to be expressed as official calculations.That is a much deeper question and it probably has to do with the attitude to the private sector with regard to investment. It may be partly linked to their available capacity constraints and how much capacity was created in the past. Another element may be the fact that many of them are saddled with projects which are probably not delivering returns and in fact one sign of that are the large non-performing assets which the banking sector is carrying that may be influencing their reluctance to enter into fresh investment.Even though business confidence has been restored, the overburden from the past is still working its way out. Before one can say that private sectors willingness to invest has been restored.It is arithmetically true that if you take aggregate and remove all elements which are positive what you will be left with are elements which are negative. But I am not sure how productive that is as an analytical exercise. It will always be possible to take any yearâ€™s GDP compilation and derive such a conclusion by stripping away elements which have positive contributions. I think there must be more than that exercise before one can get into a discussion on this being a meaningful exercise.How will GST influence GDP calculation is very hard for me to say at the moment, GST will certainly make a big change in the way India does business and therefore in the overall transactional process, how exactly will it feed into improving the growth rate? This is something which I would leave to the policy analysts to explain rather than getting into it myself.But GST will also play a big role in our measurement of GDP because a very large part of the transactional database of the country will now be captured in a single integrated structure and therefore I think in addition to whatever influences it has on the ease of doing business and the business structure of the country it will also make the measurement of that process easier.Well you know I had explained this earlier as well, we capture the informal sector through a variety of sources, about a third of the informal sector is in agriculture where we have a structured method of data capture based on acreage estimation, yield estimation and so on.Another significant chunk of the informal sector is in entities that are located in retail trade, hotels, restaurants and so on. If you notice in the new series, we are making better use of the tax database and this will become even better once the GST comes in so even though the sector does not contain accounts we are able to pick it up through the transactional database captured in the tax regime.The third major segment, is in construction where we principally at the moment gather it through input usages and the fourth one is in manufacturing and it is possible that informal manufacturing may also get picked up by the deeper coverage which the excise regime, the new GST regime will be creating but even now we are picking it up to a considerable extent through our data both in IIP and in ASI.To some extent yes because of the limitations of the older base in IPP. The newer base brings the weighting diagram of IIP in closer construct to the weighting the base structure which is used in the current GDP compilation.At the moment, we are looking at all new data sources which have become available but it would not be possible for me to tell you what will become used and how will they become used because that will only be possible when this work is complete.All I can say is that whenever base revisions take place, a fairly comprehensive review is done of all sources of data which are available and the ones which can be used with the degree of regularity and timeliness which is required for GDP compilation are used.
