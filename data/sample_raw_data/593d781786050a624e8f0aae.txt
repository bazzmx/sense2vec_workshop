Payment gateway Razorpay is aiming at doubling the number of merchants on board by next year.

“We have over 35,000 merchants on board currently, including Videocon Industries, Nykaa, Chai Point and Nestaway,” Razorpay CEO and Co-Founder Harshil Mathur told newspersons here on Friday.

Online transaction success rates have grown by 8 per cent, and in the last few months the time taken by customers to complete online transactions has gone down by 40 per cent, Mathur said. “Post demonetisation, business growth has been sustainable and not a temporary phenomenon,” he added.

Razorpay is also planning expansions in South-East Asia and the Middle East by 2018-19.

Established in 2014, it had raised a total of $11.5 million from two funding rounds in 2015 from investors such as Tiger Global, Matrix Partners and MasterCard.
