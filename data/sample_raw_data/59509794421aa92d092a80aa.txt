Airtel on Sunday announced the 'Monsoon Surprise Offer' for postpaid users, an extension of its 'Airtel Surprise Offer' by another three months. With the extension, the company is offering up to 30GB of data for three billing cycles.

To avail the Monsoon Surprise Offer, Airtel postpaid subscribers will have to log into the My Airtel app after July 1. As mentioned, Airtel is extending its up to 30GB of free data offer for three months launched for postpaid subscribers in March as the Airtel Surprise Offer. An Airtel spokesperson confirmed to PTI that the extra data will also be available to those who have already opted for the previous similar offer.

The telecom operator, alongside the rest of the industry, faced intense competition from new entrant Reliance Jio, which made its big splash last year. A fierce tariff war has raged since in the second largest telecom market in the world, with Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea urgently trying to retain subscribers in the face of unlimited calling and value for money data plans offered by Reliance Jio.

Bharti Airtel CEO, Gopal Vittal, detailed the offer in an email to subscribers, adding, "This is our way of saying thank you for being part of the Airtel family & for having trusted us and believed in us over the years. We are, and will always be, committed to nurturing this special relationship with you."
