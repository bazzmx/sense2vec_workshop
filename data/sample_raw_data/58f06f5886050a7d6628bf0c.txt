MUMBAI: Open interest in futures contracts of Infosys surged to an all-time high on Thursday owing to build-up of bearish bets after the company’s growth guidance for the current financial year missed expectations.Derivatives analysts expect the stock to languish in a narrow band of Rs 900 to Rs 1,040, a range in which it has been largely stuck for the past six months, amid muted expectations from the company in the near future, potential visa restrictions and appreciating rupee.In Infosys April futures, open interest rose 10% to 3.78 crore units, while in the cash market, the stock fell 3.7% to Rs 932.90.“It has been more of a short build-up and we may see the second round of selling,” said Ashish Chaturmohta, head of derivatives and technicals at Sanctum Wealth Management. Infosys guided for a revenue growth of 6.5-8.5% in constant currency terms against the expectation of 7-9%. Compared to the growth of 8.3% in FY17, this implies no sign of a pick-up in growth, said analysts.Some analysts said the stock was unlikely to fall below Rs 900. “Recent price pattern of the stock shows it bounces back after nearing Rs 900 levels. It is likely to happen this time, too, but sustained call writing at higher levels is likely to restrict upside,” said Chandan Taparia , a derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services April month options data for Infosys shows the highest concentration of open interest at the Rs 900 strike among put options and at Rs 1,000 strike among call options. “I don’t expect it to even cross Rs 1,000 in the short-to-medium term,” added Chaturmohta.In the past six months, the stock has moved in a narrow range, of Rs 900.3 at the lower end and Rs 1,080.7 at the higher end. It has been consistently trading below its 200-day moving average — a key long-term technical indicator — which is now placed at Rs 1,037.90.
