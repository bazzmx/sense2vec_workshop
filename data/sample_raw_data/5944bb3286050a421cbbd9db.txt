Naomi Watts' kids are sensitive

Press Trust of India |



Actress Naomi Watts says her two children, both boys, are fantastic but "very" sensitive at the same time.



The 48-year-old actress has Alexander Pete, nine, and Samuel Kai, eight, with her ex-partner Liev Schreiber.



"They're very sensitive people, they're fantastic little boys. But (I've) definitely had other times where you're like, 'Oh I can't do this!' But that's what being a parent is. You know no one's perfect. You do your best though," Watts says.



The actress says she took help of her "The Book of Henry" co-star 14-year-old Maddie Ziegler, who gained fame appearing as a dancer in various music videos for Sia, to convince her youngest son not to give up dancing, reported Entertainment Tonight.

"My son does tap dance and he was wanting to quit and feeling like he just didn't wanna do it anymore. And I asked (Maddie) to send a message to him. So I videotaped her and she said, 'Kai, don't quit. You've got to give it your all.' It was just really sweet of her to do that and my son was like, 'Ahh!' He was blown away," she says.
