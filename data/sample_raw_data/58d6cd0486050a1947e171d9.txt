Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said the government is working on a “mission mode” to deal with the swine flu and all to hospitals including private have been directed to give free treatment to the patients testing positive with immediate effect. The government will bear the cost.

Fadnavis said, “The government has asked the private hospitals also to immediately admit the patients testing swine flu and give the best of treatment. The government will bear the cost of all treatment for patients tested positive for swine flu.” We have engaged all the medical experts and hospitals in the exercise to check the rise in the swine flu. However, Congress has criticised the government for the rising cases of swine flu which lead to 149 deaths. The opposition leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, “ The health minister Deepak Sawant should resign.”

Fadnavis said, “While the cases of swine flu from Nagpur and Pune have decreased, there is a new threat emerging from Latur.” Fadnavis said, “The recent spell of rains in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra is a matter of concern as it dips the temperature and aggravates the spread of virus.” The chief secretary and health minister are closely monitoring the situation, he added.
