Banking on Big Data analytics, National Statistical Commission Chairman R.B. Barman on Tuesday said the “herculean task” to move to web-based reporting system for data processing has begun in India. “We want to move to web-based reporting system so that from field we get the data, capture the data on web-based system and once data is captured, it becomes the truth,” Barman told the media here on the sidelines of the 70th convocation ceremony of International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC) at the Indian Statistical Institute.

“The data goes everywhere and we use that truth… we want to build the system from bottom-up but with the idea and concepts coming from top-down. It’s a huge challenge, it’s a herculean task but we want to make a beginning… the process has begun,” he said.
