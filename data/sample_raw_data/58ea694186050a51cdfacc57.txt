Five children were injured during the annual Spring Carnival at Springwell Church in Taylors on Saturday.



According to Battalion Chief, Ricky Reed with the Taylors Fire Department, the structures were anchored in, but the wind ripped them from the straps.

Per a post on the church's Facebook, a wind gust lifted an inflatable that was on the campus during the event, injuring several kids.

Dispatchers say deputies with the Greenville County Sheriff's Office, EMS and fire crews are on scene at the church.

A power line was also knocked down during the incident.
