The "Britain's Got Talent" judge Amanda Holden is over the moon for star couple Cheryl and Liam Payne, who became parents in March.

Holden congratulated them via her magazine column - and said she understood why they've reportedly chosen to keep their child away from social media, reports mirror.co.uk.

"I'm over the moon for Cheryl and Liam Payne, who've had a lovely baby boy," said Holden.

"I can understand their determination to keep their son firmly out of the limelight for now," she wrote in Fabulous, adding the couple want to "enjoy this special time in private".

"He's bound to be a heartbreaker, though!" she added.

Cheryl, 33, and Payne, 23, rarely appear in public together and didn't even confirm the pregnancy until the final month.

They announced the arrival of their son four days after his birth, just in time for Mother's Day, alongside a photo of Payne cradling the newborn, whose face is away from the camera.
