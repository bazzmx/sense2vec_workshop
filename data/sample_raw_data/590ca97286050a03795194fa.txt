MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made it easier for banks to finalise a corrective action plan for non-performing assets (NPAs) allowing executives to implement the decisions of the joint lenders forum (JLF) without approvals from their boards and also reducing the number of votes required to approve a restructuring plan.The RBI decision came on the day it was empowered with legal amendments to direct banks to take action against NPAs which have been plaguing the sector for the better part of the last decade.In new timelines released on its website on Friday, RBI said that henceforth, the decisions agreed by a minimum of 60 per cent of creditors by value and 50per cent of creditors by number in the JLF would be enough to approve a restructuring plan for the loans. This is a relaxation of the earlier rule which required approval of 75per cent of creditors by value and 60per cent creditors by number.More importantly, the decision of the JLF will be binding on all members, though banks which do not support the majority decision will be given time to exit the JLF.However, banks which do not exit under the set timeframe will have to implement the majority decision of the JLF. Non-adherence to these instructions and timelines specified under the framework shall attract monetary penalties on the concerned banks under the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, RBI said.Banks also have to implement the JLF decision without any additional conditionalities.The new corrective action plan includes restructuring of project loans, change in ownership under strategic debt restructuring and the so-called scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A).
