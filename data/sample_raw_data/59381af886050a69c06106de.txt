Rajasthan Agriculture Minister Prabhu Lal Saini has claimed that cow milk has properties that can prevent cancer. “Cow milk is good for health. It is anti-cancer and has qualities similar to mother’s milk,” the minister said at the inauguration of a dairy plant in Sikar on Monday.

When contacted today, the minister said his comments were based on references the company’s officials had drawn from some research regarding the qualities of cow milk. The company that operates the plant had singed an MoU at the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet last month to set up the dairy unit in Sikar.
