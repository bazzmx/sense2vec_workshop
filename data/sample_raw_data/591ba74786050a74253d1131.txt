Another 'Grey's Anatomy' spin-off is happening and this time it is going to be fire!

ABC Network president Channing Dungey announced that the long-running medical drama would soon be getting a spin-off for the

2017-18 season that will centre on firefighters in a Seattle firehouse, E! Online reported.

The characters in the still-untitled spin-off will be introduced in a season 14 episode of 'Grey's Anatomy' before joining

the line-up midseason.

"No one can interweave the jeopardy firefighters face in the line of duty with the drama in their personal lives quite like

Shonda, and 'Grey's' signature Seattle setting is the perfect backdrop for this exciting spinoff," said Dungey.

Earlier too, Shonda Rhimes and her team have spun off the drama. Kate Walsh's Addison Montgomery was famously sent down to

to work at a new kind of practice for the spin-off 'Private Practice,' which ran on ABC for six seasons.

Grey's EP Stacy McKee will write the series and serve as executive producer, alongside Rhimes and Betsy Beers.
