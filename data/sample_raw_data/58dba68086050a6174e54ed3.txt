Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today shared the benefits of Yoga while speaking during a ‘Yoga Mahotsav’ in Lucknow and also shared how he was suddenly asked to run the state by the top BJP leadership.

During the speech, Yogi shared the similarities between Surya Namaskar practised by Hindus and Namaz done by the Muslims. “All asanas (postures) in Suryanamaskar, pranayama activities are similar with the Namaz done by our Muslim brothers. But nobody ever tried to bring them together because few people were interested only in ‘bhoga’, not yoga.”

Yogi shared that at the time BJP president Amit Shah told him that he would have to go to Uttar Pradesh, he had only a pair of clothes with him.
