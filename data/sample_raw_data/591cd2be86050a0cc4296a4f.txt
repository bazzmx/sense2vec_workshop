Regulator unveiled a food smart consumer portal for registering public grievances

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is taking a stern view of any adulteration or lapse in hygiene in the food business.At a summit on Monday, its chief executive, Pawan Kumar Agarwal, said, “We will amend regulations to make it mandatory for food business operators to have at least one person trained in food safety.“

FSSAI also launched a food safety training and certification programme (FoSTaC), which has 19 short courses -from basic to advanced and specialised courses for street food vendors, restaurants chefs, caterers, food business operators as well as the general public. The regulator unveiled a food smart consumer portal for registering grievances in order to strengthen its redressal system, along with releasing a guidance document for food handlers and regulatory staff.

FSSAI has created safe and nutritious food mascots -Master and Miss Sehat --superheroes who spread awareness among children. FSSAI will soon come out with new regulations relating to labelling of packaged and incorporate food products and incorporate the expert panel's suggestions for reducing consumption of fat, sugar and salt.

Workshops, theatre and activities can be expected in the coming months. The regulator will align with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to expand its reach.

The authority has organised a dialogue for building trust and capacity for safe food in Asia, with the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP), a publicprivate partnership hosted by the World Bank and FSSAI.
