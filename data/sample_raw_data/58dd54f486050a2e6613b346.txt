Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari today said the government will look at a legal solution to help the automakers impacted by the Supreme Court's ban on sale of BS-III vehicles from Saturday.

"We will respect the court's verdict and while implementing the order, if some legal recourse can be taken, we'll do that," he told reporters here.

He acknowledged that his ministry had earlier granted permission to the automakers to sell inventories before migrating to the stricter emission control BS-VI regime.

"We respect the court's verdict and cannot say that the judgement is wrong. After seeing the verdict, if we can help in some ways....we had taken a stand about the older stock, about allowing to sell those till the stocks get over," the Union minister said.

Asserting that the government is sensitive to environmental concerns, Gadkari said the fact that Rs 4.5 lakh crore auto industry employs 50 lakh people should not be neglected either.

An "integrated" solution benefiting the country will have to be found, he said when asked why the government, which is sensitive to ecological concerns, sided with the auto industry earlier.

The minister said the Petroleum Ministry has committed to supplying BS-VI compliant fuels before April 1 and added that the automakers have also assured to come out with vehicles which will be compliant with the norms.

The minister also listed out schemes implemented in his constituency Nagpur, such as 55 buses which run on ethanol and also promised introduction of electric taxis in two months in the Orange City.

The apex court had yesterday banned sale and registration of vehicles with the older BS-III emission norms from April 1, in a blow to auto firms saddled with a stock of over 8.2 lakh.

Such vehicles are valued up to an estimated Rs 20,000 crore.
