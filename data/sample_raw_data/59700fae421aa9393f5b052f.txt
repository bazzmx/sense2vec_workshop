At least 33 people lost their lives in clashes between villagers and herdsmen in southern part of north Nigeria's Kaduna State on Wednesday.

"Twenty-seven herdsmen living in Kajuru area of the state were killed by villagers in two separate attacks, while six villagers also died," Xinhua quoted Agyole Abeh, the state commissioner of police, as saying.

The police chief said his officers would arrest and prosecute those responsible for this dastardly and callous act.

He, however, said that calm has been restored to villages affected.

The renewed crisis was said to have erupted since Sunday when some Fulani youths reportedly went to a village at Ugwan Uka to avenge the killing of their kinsman.

Kajuru Local Government is about 50 km drive from the state capital.
