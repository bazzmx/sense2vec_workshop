CHENNAI: Tamil superstar Rajinikanth 's recent exhortation to fans to be ready for 'battle' to 'set the system right' has become a preface for his next film, Kaala Karikaalan , which is garnering huge attention from moviegoers in Tamil Nadu Soon after the title was released through the twitter handle of his actor-producer son-in-law Dhanush on Thursday morning, even the red-onblack backdrop on the title had fans wondering on social media if there was a 'Left-leaning' message."I do not think that Rajinikanth is as serious about his political career when compared to how serious he is about his career in the film industry," said a senior film critic who did not wish to be named. Industry experts believe political comments ahead of film title release may have been planned."When Rajini said that he is a true Tamilian he was very much aware Pa Ranjith film's was steeped in Tamil history," said an industry watcher who requested anonymity.Film director Pa Ranjith and Rajinikanth's office could not be reached for comments. However, Rajinikanth had clarified in his recent address, "some people say that whenever my film is about to be released I do some stunt...but because of your (fans) blessings and love, there is no need for me to do such a thing."Some other industry watchers have pointed out that unlike previous occasions, Rajinikanth has not only sent out strong political message but has been hinting about the time being right for his political entry.Major film personality have seen their films flop after joining politics. For example, MG Ramachandran 's Madhuraiyai Meetta Sundharapandiyan released in 1978 fared badly and many attributed it to the fact that it was released a year after he became CM.
