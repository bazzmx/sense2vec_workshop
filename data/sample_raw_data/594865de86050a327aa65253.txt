Co-working chain, SproutBox, on Monday, announced the launch of Indiaâ€™s largest co-working facility, SproutBox Suryavilas, at Okhla, New Delhi, to cater to the flexible requirements of its users including freelancers, start-ups and corporates.

Spread over 15,000 sq ft, it is the only facility that offers 24x7x365 operations to clients. SproutBox offers a co-working space, serviced office space, or virtual office, according to the needs of its users, according to a press release.

The facility will also be a full-time incubator working with food, food-tech, and hospitality companies, offering an auditorium, meeting rooms, in-house data centre, high-speed Internet and other amenities.

Co-working spaces, experiencing a high growth trajectory in India, are expected to receive over $400 million in investment by 2018. The segment is expected to grow by 50 per cent in 2017, according to a study by real estate firm JLL.

SproutBox was founded in 2015 by serial entrepreneurs Rajeev Gupta and Gagandeep Singh Sapra. Their first co-working facility in Gurgaon has 100 per cent occupancy and is the choice of start-ups such as Zostel, Sqrrl, Crofarm and leading corporates such as IBM and SalesForce.

With a cultural shift to mobility, more people are parting ways with their traditional work environment, ditching their cubicles and moving out. Entrepreneurs can be found to be working from a coffee shop or working from home, which are not designed for work and productivity, and have a number of distractions including noise and lack of privacy as well as unreliable WiFI. The SproutBox facility has been designed to help entrepreneurs and other co-workers find accelerated serendipity, the release added.
