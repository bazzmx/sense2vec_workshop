As many as nine civilians, including four children were killed in the United States missile attack on a military airbase in central Syria on Friday.

According to local media reports, five of the civilians, among them three children were killed just outside the base.

Media reports say that an American missile also hit the village of Al-Hamrat, which killed four civilians including a child.

Another seven civilians were also wounded when a missile hit homes in Al-Manzul, four kilometres (two and a half miles) away from the Shayrat air base.

While, stated it fired a barrage of 59 cruise missiles at the Shayrat base in response to what President Donald Trump called a 'barbaric' chemical attack on a rebel-held town on Tuesday that he blamed on the Damascus regime.

The U.S. officials said Russian commanders in Syria were informed of the strike beforehand in order to avoid casualties that could prompt a broader crisis.
