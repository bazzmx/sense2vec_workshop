NEW DELHI: There is no decision for any modification in the definition of 'cattle' at this juncture to exempt buffaloes from the purview of new central rules that prohibit sale of cows, bulls, bullocks, buffaloes, steers, heifers, calves and camels for slaughter or sacrifice in livestock markets "The ministry has got several representations - both in favour and against the new rules - in three days. One representation is also about seeking modification in the definition of cattle to exempt buffaloes . It is examining all the representations. There is no decision of any modification in definition of cattle or in any part of the new rules at this juncture," said an official of the environment ministry. He said there were representations to further tighten norms. "As a standard practice, we assured everyone to examine all the issues before taking any final decision," said the official, emphasizing that the assurance to examine such representations should not be misinterpreted. He noted that most of them did not even bother to express their views or suggestions when the ministry had come out with 'draft' rules over four months ago. Under the rules, the definition 'cattle' includes cows, buffaloes, bulls, bullocks, steers, calves & camels.
