The BSE 30-share Sensex resumed higher at 31,316.91 and moved between 31,354.51 and 31,214.35.

The market benchmark Sensex erased initial gains in late morning deals following emergence of selling in sectors like IT, teck, energy, telecom and realty. On the other hand, metal and healthcare stocks witnessed sustained buying. Cautious trade in global markets ahead of the UK elections and testimony from sacked FBI head James Comey on his probe into Donald Trumpâ€™s links to Russia also influenced sentiment, brokers said.
