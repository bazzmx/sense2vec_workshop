In a chat with ET Now Head-Equity Research Wealth says consumption as a theme including auto, some of the building material names could also be outperformers.Edited excerpts:It would be difficult to comment on the next outperformers at these levels. As I already highlighted, we are a bit cautious on the market at the current juncture and as you rightly highlighted that there are pockets which could be on the high valuation zone and there are laggards which are moving up because of the liquidity However, among the broad themes that could do well, obviously consumption is a sector which continues to do well in India. In consumption, you can look at some of the auto names, consumer durable names, all of which could be the consistent outperformers.Some of the building material names in the large and mid-cap space would do well. Another sector as highlighted earlier is the housing finance companies which have been consistent outperformers and going by the trend the focus is on affordable housing for the next few years. The smaller housing finance companies could be outperformers over the next few years.Regarding aviation, we do not have a view right now but the numbers are supportive and that is what is being reflected in the stocksâ€™ performance. The reason why we do not have a view is the sector has multiple variables and it is always difficult to predict. It is dependent on crude oil prices, exchange currency as well as domestic demand which is dependent on the prices. And to top it all, the high debt on the books of these companies makes us a bit uncomfortable for the sector.We are cautious on the market in the short term. We as wealth manager advisors are recommending generating cash at the current levels of anywhere between 10-15% to benefit from any fall in the market in the near term.
