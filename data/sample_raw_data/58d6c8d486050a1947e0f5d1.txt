Jaguarâ€™s 3-Series rival, Jaguar XE, has bagged the Euro NCAP's prestigious Best in Class Cars of 2015 awards, coming first in the large family car category. The XE has already received the maximum five star rating during Euro NCAP tests in 2015 with Euro NCAP praising the high levels of active and passive safety systems fitted to the XE as standard. The Jaguar XE is expected to make its Indian debut at the 2016 Expo.

Mr. Kevin Stride, Vehicle Line Director, Jaguar XE, XF, F-PACE said, "We set out to develop the driver's car in the segment, but also we wanted to provide outstanding levels of occupant and pedestrian safety. By combining our Advanced Aluminium Architecture with the most advanced technology available we were able to meet all of our targets. The XE has already proven itself the benchmark for vehicle dynamics, and now this Euro NCAP award is recognition that we delivered on safety as well."

Despite the tough Euro NCAP's 2015 test protocols, which brought in the new full width frontal crash test for the first time, the XE shined through with a five star rating thanks to its light, stiff Advanced Aluminium Architecture and the advanced driver assistance systems. The Jaguar XE also scored high on Adult Occupant protection, Pedestrian protection and Safety Assist, thanks to features including the deployable bonnet and Autonomous Emergency Braking.

Mr. Michiel van Ratingen, Secretary General, Euro NCAP said, "Euro NCAP gives top honours to the Jaguar XE which offers the highest levels of occupant protection and avoidance technology, and rewards the XE as Best in Class of 2015 in the large family segment. Euro NCAP particularly congratulates Jaguar for making all important Safety Assist features standard equipment."
