Coal India (CIL) has produced 155.4 million tonnes of coal in April-July 2017-18 against the target of 168 mt, thereby missing the target by 12.6 mt

According to a BSE filing, the output in July was 36.6 mt against the target of 37.6 mt. Consumption stood at 181.6 mt compared to the stipulated 194 mt.

Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal production, is eyeing 1 billion tonne output by 2020.

The government had earlier said there were no plans to cut down coal output because of hardening demand.

In October last year, demand had started picking up for both coal and power sectors.
