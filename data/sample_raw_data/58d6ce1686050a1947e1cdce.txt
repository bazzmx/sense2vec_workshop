Vijender Singh vs Kerry Hope was attended by the who's who of sports, entertainment and politics, including boxer M C Mary Kom, who choked a bit while acknowledging a loud applause from the crowd, star wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, cricketers Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina, actor Randeep Hooda.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi was booed by the crowd at the Thyagaraj stadium where he had come to watch Vijender Singh's WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight Championship title bout. Sporting a grey t-shirt and demins, Gandhi walked into the stadium only to see a part of the crowd boo him and then chant 'Modi, Modi', referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 46-year-old, who sat beside IPL Chairman Rajiv Shukla, had a similar experience when he walked out of the stadium after the end of the title clash which Vijender won after beating Australia's Kerry Hope.
