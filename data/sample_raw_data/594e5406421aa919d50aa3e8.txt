BEIJING â€” Fears are growing for 141 villagers missing in China after a landslide buried their mountain settlement in southwestern Sichuan province, with reports that only three survivors had been pulled out of the mud and rock.

The landslide swept over 46 homes as dawn broke at around 6 a.m. local time Saturday (6 p.m. Friday ET) in Xinmo village in Maoxian county, a remote mountainous area of north Sichuan close to Tibet, according to the official Xinhua state news agency.

President Xi Jinping urged on the rescue effort, but state broadcaster CCTV reported that the only people rescued were a couple and their two-month-old baby.

Xinhua said the estimated number of missing was provided by local authorities.

The landslide blocked a 1.24 mile stretch of a nearby river and road, according to Xinhua.

State television pictures showed rescuers scrambling over mounds of mud and rocks that had slid down the mountainside. Xinhua said there were 400 people involved in the rescue effort and six ambulances were at the scene, and more were on their way.

The television images showed water thick with mud flowing over the site, submerging a car pushed from the road, while police and residents pulled on ropes to try to dislodge large boulders.
