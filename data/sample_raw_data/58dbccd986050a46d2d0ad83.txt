Minister today allayed apprehensions about rise in prices of goods and commodities after the roll out of saying rates will be kept at near current levels to ensure that there is no inflationary impact.



Introducing four bills to give effect to the Goods and Services Tax, Jaitley said preparations to roll out the new regime is nearing completion and the process to classify categories of commodities will start next month.

The aim of the Council is to decide everything relating to the structure with consensus and this is for the first time that such an arrangement has been made, based on the principle of shared sovereignty of both the Centre and the state governments, he said."The council is India's first federal institution where sovereignty of the Centre and the states in relation to indirect taxes have been pulled in together in a federal institution."It is incumbent on all of us to make sure that this federal institution works. The delicate balance between what the Centre and states have unanimously agreed is almost a federal contract. Its is federal contract with constitutional sanction," Jaitley said.The basic principle to determine on items will be to find out the current components and bracket them under the nearest slab so that the prices do not increase, he said.Jaitley said the four legislations will have to be passed by Parliament and one by each of the state assemblies to turn into one market with a single rate.The bills introduced are the Central Goods and Services Bill, 2017, the Integrated Goods and Services Bill, 2017, the Goods and Services (Compensation to States) Bill, 2017 and the Union Territory Goods and Services Bill, 2017.Explaining the bills, he said the Central or CGST will give powers to the Centre to levy after excise, service and additional customs duty are all subsumed. The Integrated or IGST will be a to be levied by the Centre on inter-state movement of goods and services.The states will pass the State or SGST law that will allow them to levy sales after VAT and the like are subsumed.Besides, compensation law allows for imposition of cess on certain luxury goods like tobacco, high-end cars and aerated drinks to create a corpus for compensating states for any loss of revenue in the first five years of roll out.The fourth law introduced is on Union Territory or UTGST for UTs like Chandigarh and Daman and Diu which do not have assemblies."We are creating by law a jurisdiction simultaneously both in the Centre and states and in the process handing over indirect administration to the first federal institution that has created where Centre and the States will both participate," he said.The Council will make recommendations to the Centre and states on tax, cess and surcharges besides deciding on exemptions and model goods.It has already approved four-tier slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent plus an additional cess on demerit goods like luxury cars, aerated drinks and tobacco products. The work on putting various goods and services in the different slabs is slated to begin next month.Jaitley said the beyond 28 per cent on luxury items will be considered as compensation for the next 5 years and the money will go to the fund from where states losing on will be compensated.He said if any fund is left after paying compensation, it will be shared between states and Centre.Referring to bracket of luxury goods, he said the extra component beyond 28 per cent has been kept as cess as keeping it as would have negative impact on the consumers.Jaitley said as keeping it as would have resulted some portion of the money going to devolution. "To make a compensation package of Rs 50,000, we would have to levy of Rs 1.72 lakh crore."He said that "some rules have been made and remaining rules will be ready by 31st. The council made a broad arrangement on division of work between the Centre and State. Besides that the process to classify which commodities will fall in which category will start next month".He added: "The law that we are dealing with...Even though Parliament and State legislatures have plenary power to legislate but this is a unique experience of Indian legislatures because ordinarily they legislate in areas which exclusively belongs to the domain of Parliament or domain of the state legislatures."Referring to functioning of the council, he said all the parties need to adopt positive approach as the system may badly hit if the contracting parties take "unilateral decisions"."There can be a situation where all the 32 legislatures (members of the council) may say I will make one or two changes to the law that we all have agreed...Unilateralism is possible if the area is exclusively in your domain," he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several senior members of the Union Cabinet were present in the House when the four bills were taken up for consideration and passage.
