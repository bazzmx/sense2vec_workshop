India’s salt to software conglomerate Tata Group is giving thought to reorganise its technology and infrastructure businesses in order to reduce the number of companies it manages, as per a report published in Livemint.

The report, quoting people aware of the development, said that many of the group’s technology businesses would move into the fold of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS), which generates a bulk of the group’s revenue.

The conglomerate manages more than 100 operating companies in its fold and wants to shed some units, which do not fit into the core businesses.

TCS may take over the control of Tata Elxsi, a product engineering and solution firm along with Tata Interactive Systems, which deals in computer-assisted learning products, as well as privately held Tata Business Support Services Ltd.

After taking over as Tata Sons’ Chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran has been focusing on overhauling the USD 100 billion conglomerate and had hired former investment banker Saurabh Agrawal as chief financial officer, a post lying vacant for five years.

There are also plans to combine several infrastructure businesses into a single company. This could include air-conditioning and engineering services provider Voltas , Tata Realty & Infrastructure Limited which builds bridges and airports and EPC firm Tata Projects.
