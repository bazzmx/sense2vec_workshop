Sofia Vergara to voice Flamenco Dancer in Emoji Movie

Press Trust of India |



Actress Sofia Vergara has been tapped to voice the Flamenco Dancer emoticon in the new Emoji Movie, based on the cartoon faces and beings found on mobile phones.



Vergara, 44, shared the news of her casting on Instagram with a photo of herself in a red outfit standing alongside an enlarged version of the female flamenco with a flowing dress and rose in her mouth.



"Excited to be Flamenco Dancer in @emojimovie!!! #emojimovie," she captioned the picture, complete with the emoji itself.



"She does it in the morning when she gets up, she does it when she's eating, she probably does it when she's sleeping," Sofia laughed. "It makes things like driving or putting on her make-up very difficult.

"I thought it was a great adventure and who doesn't like an emoji? I thought it was going to be a perfect role for me because people are always saying that I look like her," the actress told People magazine.
