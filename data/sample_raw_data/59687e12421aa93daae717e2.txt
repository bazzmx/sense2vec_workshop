A former Congressional staffer was indicted on charges that he spread nude and embarrassing images online of his lawmaker boss, the delegate to from the American Virgin Islands.

According to court documents on Thursday, Juan McCullum, 35, took "private, nude images and videos" from the cellphone of Delegate Stacey Plaskett in March 2016 after offering to assist in repairing her malfunctioning, password-protected cellular phone by taking her iPhone to an Apple store, reports CNN.

The following July, McCullum created a fake email account and sent at least 10 messages with one or more of the images attached to members of the media, other politicians and people known to Plaskett, the documents said.

He also posted the images online to a fake Facebook account.

McCullum is charged with two counts of cyberstalking.

Another former Plaskett staffer, Dorene Browne-Louis, faces obstruction of justice charges for allegedly misleading law enforcement on the case and deleting text messages from McCullum, according to the Thursday indictment, CNN reported.

In a statement, Plaskett said she was "deeply grateful to the Capitol Police and US Attorney for the District of Columbia for their thorough and in depth investigating of the crimes committed against me and those who I love".
