Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw after they appeared alongside extremist content, said on Tuesday it was introducing new tools to give firms greater control.

"We know advertisers don't want their next to content that doesn't align with their values," Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a post on the internet giant's blog.

"So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content."

The move came a day after an apology by a senior executive after the British and a handful of top firms including and HSBC pulled their adverts after they appeared alongside extremist content on its internet platforms.

Schindler said will tighten safeguards to ensure that show up only against legitimate creators on its video-sharing site YouTube, and "is taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platform".

A boycott by firms worried about damaging their image could cause incredible damage to as advertising makes up the overwhelming majority of the internet giant's revenue.

Schindler said acknowledged that companies have brand guidelines which dictate where and when they want their to appear and that it wants to give them more control to do that.

"In the coming days and months, we're introducing new tools for advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their appear across and the web," said Schindler.

The British put its advertising on hold on Monday, saying "it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content - and that message was conveyed very clearly to "

A spokesman said: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across platforms whilst the matter is worked through."
