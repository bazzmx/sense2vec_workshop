The conundrum is not an easy issue to resolve and only a long term policy can tackle it, Chief Minister and former Defence Minister said on Friday.

Parrikar also said that there was a lot of pressure on him when he was serving as the Defence Minister in the national capital.

"It is not easy to resolve the issue. There is a need for a long-term policy to resolve the issue," Parrikar said at the 126th birth anniversary celebration of Babasaheb Ambedkar here.

He also said that New Delhi wasn't a place he got habituated to.

"Delhi is not my place. It is not the place I am habituated to. There was a lot of pressure on me," Parrikar said.
