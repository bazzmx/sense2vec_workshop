The state-run HUDCO, which provides loans for housing and urban infrastructure projects in India, recently raised over Rs 1,120 crore as a part of its IPO, assisting the government's efforts to meet its disinvestment target.



The company enjoys strong relationship with the state governments and their agencies and finances various central and state government schemes in housing and urban infrastructure development. In most cases these loans are subject to repayment through allocations in state government budgets or recourse to alternate sources of revenue, which reduces the recovery risk of loans to state governments and their agencies.



“As at December 31, 2016, gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio for loans to state governments and their agencies was 0.75% as compared with total gross NPA of 6.80%.
