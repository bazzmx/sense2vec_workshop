Authorities in Ohio are interviewing victims to identify suspects involved in the shooting at a Columbus club that left nine wounded early Sunday.

An argument sparked gunfire at the J&R Party Hall on Cleveland Ave.where five women and four men were shot after 3 a.m., police said.

Those victims’ injuries range from minor to life-threatening, police said.

Authorities have identified the victims as Sharda Hall, 25; Brooklyn Bradley, 20; Diamond Harris, 33; Ja'Voughn Henderson, 22; Cornecia Pruitt, 25; Keante McGrew, 31; Kaadijah Travis, 23; William Boswell, 27, and Jawaun McCrae, 20, according to 10TV.

Multiple-caliber shell casings were found inside the venue. Seven victims are being treated at Grant Medical Center, and two others are at Ohio State University Medical Center, the station reported.

Police said they have interviewed victims, but they have either refused to cooperate with the authorities or claim that they did not see what happened. A motive for the shooting wasn’t immediately clear.

Last month, a dispute in Cincinnati’s Cameo nightclub prompted a shooting that left 15 people wounded and two dead.
