NEW DELHI: Gold prices were trading lower in early trade on Wednesday on account of subdued demand of precious metals from buyers, retailers and industries.MCX Gold was trading 0.30 per cent, or Rs 86, down at Rs 28,725 per 10 gram around 10.18 am (IST), while MCX Silver was trading 0.14 per cent, or Rs 56, up at Rs 39,930 per 1 kg.According to Angel Commodities , gold is likely to trade lower on Wednesday on account of profit booking at higher levels after a recent rally. Stronger dollar index will further exert downside pressure on the yellow metal.On Wednesday’s movement, Nirmal Bang Commodities said, “We expect prices to trade range bound for the day as investors waited for cues on the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike stance from minutes of the central bank’s latest meeting, due later in the day.” SPDR Gold Trust GLD , the world’s largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, said its latest holdings stood at 847.45 tonnes down 5.03 tonnes, from previous business day.Latest holdings of the largest silver backed exchange-traded-fund (ETF), New York’s iShares Silver Trust SLV, stood at 10,693.85 tonnes, remain unchanged from previous business day.
