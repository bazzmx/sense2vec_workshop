Shivpal Yadav has announced the launch of a new political outfit, Samajwadi Secular Front, in Uttar Pradesh with his elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav as the president. Shivpal has announced the party will be officially launched on July 6, according to a NewsX report. Shivpal had earlier claimed the front will help save Samajwadi Party from becoming weaker, according to IE.

Shivpal on May 6, had told the Indian Express that the new front will work to uplift and give social empowerment to the poor, Other Backward Class (OBC), Dalits, Muslims, farmers and other deprived sections of the society. Shivpal had also said that Mulayam Singh will be the national president of his front and he would meet secular and socialist leaders to join him and work for together for the cause of social justice. Shivpal Yadav, who is a five-time MLA from Jaswant Nagar in Etawah, had then said that he was still a member of Samajwadi Party, now led by Mulayam’s son and ex-UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, hadn’t made any plan to leave the party.

Lashing out at Akhilesh earlier this month, Shivpal had said, ”Akhilesh had promised to form the government, the party is becoming week as Mulayam is no longer the party president”.

According to an IE report, Akhilesh could face problems as many party leaders, who feel sidelined by him, may now join Shivpal’s outfit, weakening Samajwadi Party’s chances in the upcoming local body elections in urban areas of Uttar Pradesh. The formation of a new party may also hurt the Opposition in the upcoming Presidential elections.
