As tradition goes, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A smartphone will go on sale in India on Thursday, via exclusive online retail partner Amazon India. However, unlike previous weeks, the Amazon Great Indian Sale has begun, and the e-commerce website has limited availability of the smartphone only to Amazon Prime subscribers. It will be available at Rs. 5,999.

On Thursday, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A (Review) will go on sale via Amazon India between 3pm and 4pm IST - and as we mentioned, it will only be available to Amazon Prime members. The company notes that users in their free trial will still be eligible to buy the smartphone - users can also sign up now and become eligible for the sale later on Thursday. The online marketplace notes that the Citibank cashbank offer is not applicable. To recall, during the Amazon Great Indian Sale, credit and debit cards issued by Citibank are eligible for an additional 10 percent cashback on purchases made using the desktop site, and 15 percent on shopping via the app.
