The Nifty closed at a fresh closing record high of 9,595 on Friday which has opened upside for next crucial target of 9,700-9,800. However, the market is likely to start flat as US markets will remain shut on account of Memorial Day.

The Nifty formed a strong bulls candle after ‘Long White Day’ which suggests that bulls are in control of D-Street and any dips seen today were largely bought into.

However, after such a sharp upmove this week, some bit of consolidation cannot be ruled out in the coming week, but the index is ripe to hit next crucial target of 9,700-9,800.

A strong Bull candle signifies that the market witnessed sustained buying interest from the bulls for the most part of the trading session. As long as the Nifty holds above 9,520 levels, the rally could extend towards 9,700-9,800 levels, suggest experts.
