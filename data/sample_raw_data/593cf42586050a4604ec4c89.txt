As US President Donald Trump's scheduled meeting with Silicon Valley leaders is drawing close, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has said that attending the meeting is like waterboarding yourself after drinking a bottle of gin.

"If you don't get invited to this meeting and want to know what it was like, just drink a bottle of gin and then waterboard yourself," Costolo said in a tweet on Saturday.

Costolo, who headed Twitter from 2010 to 2015, made the comment in reference to a BuzzFeed report about Trump's impending meeting with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the tech space later this month.

The relation between Silicon Valley leaders and Trump has remained complicated since the real estate tycoon was elected President in November.

Trump met a number of CEOs and other industry leaders in December to smooth tensions following disagreements throughout his campaign.
