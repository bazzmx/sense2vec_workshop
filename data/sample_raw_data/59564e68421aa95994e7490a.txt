New Delhi: Moving away from a three-day rise, gold prices sank 100 to Rs 29,200 per 10 grams on Friday as global weakness and easing local demand came as a spoiler.

Silver went the same way, which declined Rs 200 to Rs 39,300 per kg owing to lower demand from industrial units and coin makers. Enthusiasm for the yellow metal was lacking at the domestic spot market, traders said.
