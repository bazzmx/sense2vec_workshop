Late King of Pop Michael Jacksons son Prince has paid a tribute to his father with a special tattoo.

In the tattoo, shared by Prince over Instagram, a cartoon of Michael can be seen wearing a red shirt, a black blazer with a red arm band, suspenders, loafers, fedora and a white-sequin glove, reports aceshowbiz.com.

He strikes a pose with both arms up. The tattoo was inked on Prince's calf.

According to Prince, it took nine hours to get the "incredible and beautiful tattoo" done.

"Thanks (tattoo artist) Justin Lewis for sitting 9 hours with me for such an incredible and beautiful tattoo. I will be posting more of this," Price wrote in the caption.
