For riskaverse investors who prefer equities primarily for dividend income, the auto sector could be emerging as a favoured choice for the next few years. Free cash with automakers is expected to increase thanks to small capital expenditure need and expanding profit bases.This means automakers will have more cash available to distribute as dividends. Analysts said dividend payout at India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki is likely to be higher in the coming years, followed by Eicher Motors Hero Motors and Bajaj Auto Indian automakers have negative working capital -number of days to pay to its supplier more than it gives to dealers while selling cars -and limited capital expenditure has expanded the ratio of free cash flow to profit to 50-80 per cent, while automakers have dividend payout between 20 and 50 per cent.The rate is expected to grow further. A CLSA note said the ratio of free cash to net profit will reach 87 per cent, 74 per cent, 73 per cent, 71 per cent, 57 per cent on an average between FY 18 and FY19 for Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp Bajaj Auto, and Maruti , respectively.The projected free cash to net profit indicates that Maruti, Ashok Leyland, and Eicher could raise their dividend payouts by 25-30 per cent, while Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, and TVS Motors has potential to hike it by 10-20 per cent. Maruti Suzuki is the most likely candidate for a dividend payout hike in the near term as its parent Suzuki Motors will be investing close to Rs 18,500 crore for expanding capacity at their new plant in Gujarat. The new facility in Gujarat will act as contractors to manufacture for Maruti, while full ownership with remain with Suzuki Motors.Suzuki Motors has 56 per cent stake in the Indian subsidiary Maruti Suzuki. Maruti's average dividend is 22 per cent in the past two years, however, based on the projected free cash flow to net profit it can hike that to 45-50 per cent.
