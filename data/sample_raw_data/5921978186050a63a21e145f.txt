The Indian Navy on Sunday said it has located a Maldivian landing craft which had gone missing two days back, and all crew members are safe.

The landing craft Maria 3 was travelling from K Thulusdhoo, an island in the Maldives archipelago, to another island, L Gan, on Thursday when it went missing.

The Indian Navy had sent a Kora-class corvette, INS Kirch, and a Dornier aircraft to locate the missing boat.

Indian Ambassador to the Maldives Akhilesh Mishra applauded the crew of the Indian Navy Dornier, Indian Navy ALH, and INS Kirch and their Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) colleagues for their exemplary coordination and cooperation to ensure success of the humanitarian operation.

"I feel very proud of the professionalism, unflinching courage and commitment to duty displayed by the Indian naval officers in undertaking the search and rescue operation in an extremely challenging weather," the Ambassador said.

On Saturday evening the Dornier picked a vessel floating around 60 nautical miles away from its last known position, and informed the ship which was around 50 nautical miles away, the Indian Navy said.

The boat, which had its forward ramp collapsed and was unable to propel, was then located by INS Kirch.

"Kirch has confirmed all crew members are safe. MNDF has been informed," Navy spokesperson Captain D.K. Sharma said.

A joint boarding party was sent with first light to provide assistance, the spokesperson said.
