Something just doesn’t add up.

A Brooklyn man apparently didn’t have $2.75 to get on the train, but claimed he could come up with $50,000 if cops didn’t arrest him for using a student MetroCard that didn’t belong to him.

Jesus Rodriguez allegedly offered transit cops the cash incentive after he was busted at a Brooklyn subway station, officials said Saturday.

Cops grabbed Rodriguez, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, around noon on Thursday when he used the student MetroCard to enter the Hoyt-Schermerhorn St. station, officials said.

When cops stopped him, he freely admitted the card belonged to his girlfriend.

Police took Rodriguez into custody for fare evasion and brought him to an NYPD transit police station, where he allegedly approached a sergeant and offered the supervisor $50,000 to let him go.

The sergeant recorded the offer, and Rodriguez was charged with bribery, criminal trespass and fare evasion, officials said.

A judge ordered him released without bail during a brief arraignment Thursday night.

Attempts to reach Rodriguez were not successful Saturday.
