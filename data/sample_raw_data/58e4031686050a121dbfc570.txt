The US trade deficit with China dropped to $23 billion in February from $31.3 billion in January.

President Donald Trump, who during last year's campaign repeatedly accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, will meet on Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his residence in Palm Beach, Florida.

Last week, Trump signed two executive orders intended to prevent unfair practices in international trade and identify those he calls "cheaters" and accuses of causing the loss of millions of US manufacturing jobs.
