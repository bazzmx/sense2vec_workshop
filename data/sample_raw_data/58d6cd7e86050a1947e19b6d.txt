Chief Minister P.S.Badal during the Eid at Malerkotla .

After a gap of almost two years, Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal attended an Eid function at Malerkotla’s Idgah on Friday.

Ever since Bhagwant Mann won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Sangrur, the chief minister has not been seen at many public functions at Malerkotla. The CM pointed to his busy calendar for his absence from functions in Malerkotla.

On Friday, however, the chief minister came to the area along with Parminder Singh Dhindsa and local MLA Farzana Alam and handed over a cheque worth almost Rs 23 lakh for renovating a Haj building.

Badal used the opportunity to take a dig at Mann.

“Entertainers can never do anything good for the state. They can misguide you for a while, or even make you laugh, but when it comes to politics, they fail utterly. So one should believe in serious politician who actually works for your welfare,” Badal said.

Other leaders too seemed to focus on Mann in their speeches at Idgah.

Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal also said that the government would look into setting up of a food park and a sewerage treatment plant in the area.
