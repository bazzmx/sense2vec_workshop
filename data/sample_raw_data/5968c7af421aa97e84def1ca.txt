These developments render NowFloats as the first horizontal SaaS solution provider in India, offering customized products for specific verticals.

"NowFloats was incepted with the idea simplifying solutions in a way that was equally effective for any small and medium However, we soon realized that by customizing our offerings and making it vertical specific we could facilitate our customers better. Recognizing the potential of our realization, we focused on manufacturing vertical and witnessed a surge in our customer base in almost no time. Our transition from vertical-agnostic to vertical specific approach has emerged to be profitable for our clients by manifolds," said co-founder and chief software architect NowFloats, Ronak Samantray.

NowFloats ever since its launch has managed to get many small and medium businesses come online and widen their horizons.

Tailoring its product to make it vertical specific has yielded better results. For Example, the brand has been able to generate almost 24 million visits to all merchants in the manufacturing segment till date.
