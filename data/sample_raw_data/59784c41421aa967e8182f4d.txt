A sense of complacency has crept into global markets which are trading at record high. The low reading of volatility indicators amidst elevated index level shows that investors — thanks to generous money creation by global central banks — are unconcerned about a possible correction.The CBOE VIX — a barometer of volatility and often termed as a fear gauge — is trading at 9.43, nearly 54 per cent lower than its 20-year average.The benchmark is at its lowest level since 2007, and stayed low for the longest stretch on record. Even in the domestic market, India VIX (the local volatility indicator) is toeing the global path. India VIX is trading at 10.86, which is 47 per cent lower than its 10-year average. The implied volatility of in-themoney call and put options of the Nifty August options are in single digit.Typically, implied volatility increases when investors believe that asset price will decline and markets may turn bearish; and, vice-versa. The divergence between the index level and volatility has pushed the complacency index — the ratio of enterprise value in the MSCI World index to VIX — to at a two decade high. Historical data indicate that a high complacency index is often followed by a correction in the equity market.Despite bloated valuations, investors continue to rule out chances of wild price swings. As a result, they are willing to fork out very low option premium to hedge against price swings.It's happening at a time when major global indices such as S&P 500 (US), Mexbol (Mexico), Kospi (South Korea), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), and Nifty have Relative strength index (RSI) — a momentum indicator used by technical analysts to capture the pace at which stock prices are rising — of more than 65.On Tuesday, the number crossed 70 for Nifty — a level at which chartists believe the market is entering an over-bought zone. The market is said to be in an oversold zone when this index is below 30.
