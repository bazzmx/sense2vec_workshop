Casio Computer Co., Ltd., announced today the release of new additions to its EDIFICE line of high performance sports chronographs that combine dynamic design with advanced technology. The four new EQS-600 models are solar powered chronographs featuring 3D inset dials.

Under the concept of "Speed and Intelligence", the EDIFICE brand evokes the sense of velocity found in motorsports, while offering diverse functions made possible by cutting-edge electronics technology.

The new EQS-600 watches are solar powered, and they feature a stopwatch that can measure up to 30 minutes in one second increments. The inset dial in the six o'clock position serves as a battery level indicator for added convenience.

The watches also feature three-dimensional inset dials. Utilizing proprietary molding technology developed by Yamagata Casio in Japan, the inset dials are integrated with the 3D watch face, producing a dynamic look unique to EDIFICE.

The dial accent lines of red, blue or gold set off a design that evokes an advanced image of high velocity. The same accent colors are used for the second hand, for greater design impact and readability.
