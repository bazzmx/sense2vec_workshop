Only available in the three-door variant.

After its local debut at the Auto Expo 2016, Volkswagen India has launched the VW Polo GTI as the ‘Volkswagen GTI’ at INR 25.99 Lakhs (ex-showroom Delhi). It’s only available in the three-door variant and limited to 99 units at launch.

The Volkswagen GTI slots between entry-level 5-door hot hatches like the Fiat Punto Abarth, VW Polo GT TSI and premium hot hatches like the Mini Cooper S and Abarth 595 Competizione. It costs nearly INR 17 lakhs more than the 105 hp Polo GT TSI and INR 16 lakh than its closest competitor, the 147 hp Punto Abarth. Coupled with the 3-door bodystyle, the GTI comes across as a niche offering that could appeal to young driving enthusiasts, but however it is marketed, it looks overpriced.

The GTI packs a 1.8L TSI four-cylinder turbopetrol engine that produces 189 hp and 250 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels via a 7-speed DSG gearbox with steering-mounted paddle shifters. It is capable of sprinting from 0-100 km/h in 7.2 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 233 km/h. Changes specific to the Indian market include suspension tuning and better dust-proofing.
