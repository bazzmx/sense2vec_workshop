He may be a very busy man, just today his plate was full, what with having to attend the NITI Aayog’s Governing Council meet where all the chief ministers had gathered to chalk out the way forward as far India’s developmental agenda was concerned, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a die-hard cricket fan too and keeps himself updated about it, and in this case, he even knew quite a bit about a child of an iconic former cricketer. We are referring to former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes and his daughter called ‘India’ and the date in question was none else but her birthday today!

Taking to Twitter PM Modi tonight wished Rhodes’ daughter, who has been named ‘India’, on her second birthday. Rhodes had named his daughter ‘India’ in April 2015. Currently, he is in India as part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) bandwagon on the coaching staff of Mumbai Indians. Rhodes had posted a picture of himself with his daughter on Twitter earlier saying, “Happy Birthday baby India; 2 today #landofyourbirth.”

And why did Rhodes name his daughter after India? According to the cricketer, who was especially known for his outstanding fielding, he appreciated India’s rich mix of culture, heritage and tradition and so named his daughter ‘India’, according to news agency PTI.

“It is a very spiritual country, very forward-thinking nation. I really like that combination. You have to have a good balance of life. With the name like India, she will have the best of both worlds and that sort of balance,” Rhodes was quoted as saying by PTI.
