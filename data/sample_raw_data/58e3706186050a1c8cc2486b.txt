At the inaugural rally of the Dharmnirapeksh Sevak Sangh (DSS), a youth organisation to counter the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in Patna, Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap sat on a makeshift chariot along with four other people symbolising different religions. “Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Modi asked me to join the RSS; now I ask him to join the Our organisation treats all religions equally,” said Pratap. The incident he was referring to was a dinner hosted at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s home a few days back. Seeing Pratap having a meal, Modi had reportedly told him, “You are a fit candidate to join our party.”
