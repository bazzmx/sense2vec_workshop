Google is currently running a promo where-in users can get a movie rental of their choice for as low as $0.99. You have around 100 movie options to choose from.

The offer is limited to one movie rental per user, and most importantly, it's open to only specific Google Play users based on their purchase history. Reports say the deal might be different for different users - like for some, the rental is $1.50.

Head to the Google Play Movies page, and if you see the deal advertisement, then you're in luck. Click the ad, and redeem the offer using the prompt that opens up.

"Discount will be added to 'Account => Rewards' and applied at checkout," the T&C say. "Redeem your offer by July 7 2017 on Google Play from compatible Internet connected devices using a Google account."
