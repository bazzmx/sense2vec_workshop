Japan’s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell to zero percent for the first time since November as U.S. Treasury yields plunged on weak economic data, while lingering tensions over North Korea and uncertainty over France’s presidential election keep haven demand intact.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell eight basis points Tuesday to a five-month low of 2.17 percent. The Guardian reported the U.S. military is considering shooting down North Korean missile tests, citing two unidentified people briefed on the planning. The U.S. is closely monitoring the situation in North Korea, a White House spokesman said.

The Bank of Japan aims to keep 10-year yield around zero percent under its yield curve control policy to bolster momentum for economic recovery. If international factors push Japanese yields lower than that, it may hamper the central bank’s effort to achieve a 2 percent inflation target.

“Given the close correlation between JGBs and Treasuries, Japan’s 10-year yield hitting zero came as no surprise especially with risk aversion spurring an unwinding of the reflationary trade,” said Naoya Oshikubo, a rates strategist at Barclays Plc in Tokyo. As the BOJ targets zero percent for the 10-year yield, it could prove a hard line to break, he said.

The BOJ will buy bonds with 1-to-5-year and 5-to-10-year maturities on Wednesday. Oshikubo said the central bank is likely to keep purchases for the 5-to-10-year sector unchanged if the 10-year yield remained at zero, but if it fell below that level before the operation, it could curb its purchases. The BOJ will announce the operation at 10:10 a.m. in Tokyo.

On Monday, the BOJ kept unchanged the monthly purchase amount for 5-to-10-year maturities at 450 billion yen ($4.1 billion) The central bank had boosted that figure from 410 billion yen in late January when yields were rising toward 0.1 percent.
