The High on Wednesday dismissed the plea of Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj challenging the Commission's decision to not allot the common symbol to contest upcoming municipal corporations elections.

Appearing for the state commission, advocate Sumit Pushkarna had earlier submitted before the that they didn't have the power to allot symbols to unrecognised but registered political parties, adding that this power was vested with the Commission of (ECI).

Swaraj India, a party led by Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, approached the High earlier last week challenging the state commission's denial to their plea for a common symbol in the upcoming civic polls.

The state commission, earlier on March 14, announced April 22 as the date for Municipal Corporation of (MCD) polls.

The petitioner said the poll panel denied the request for a symbol on March 7 despite a provision in the rules to provide a symbol to a registered but unrecognised political party like Swaraj which is set to make its electoral debut.

Senior advocate Arvind Nigam mentioned the matter before a bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and V.K. Rao for an urgent hearing.

Swaraj was floated by Yadav and Bhushan, who were expelled from the (AAP) after they questioned Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's leadership.

The lawyer argued that under the Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) (Amendment) order, the Commission of itself allows newly registered political parties to have a common symbol for all their candidates for contesting their first

The party has claimed that states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal, Kerala, Sikkim and Tripura follow the rules made by the Commission of (ECI).
