Haasan said a comment could be made about it only during poll time. He, however, said there was nothing “wrong“ or “different“ in the Kabali star's remark that the “system was rotten“. Rajinikanth, while addressing his fans recently, had said the system was rotten though there were efficient political leaders. “The system is rotten. We should change the system. While the system was `affected,' people's thought process on policy and democracy had changed and this needs to be addressed by one and all,“ he had said last week.The `Vishwaroopam' star said Rajinikanth's comments on the system been `rotten' was what “everybody says,“ and it was not different or wrong.
