The Finance Ministry has extended by one year the validity of anti-dumping duty on soda ash imports from China, European Union, Kenya, Pakistan, Iran, Ukraine and the US. The existing anti-dumping duty will be valid till July 2 next year, the Revenue Department has said. This is, however, subject to the final decision of the Gujarat High Court in the special civil application that challenged the Designated Authorityâ€™s final findings (September 2016) on the mid-term review.

The latest Revenue Department move follows the Designated Authority in the Commerce Ministry initiating a sunset review investigation on June 16 this year and recommending an extension of existing anti-dumping duty.
