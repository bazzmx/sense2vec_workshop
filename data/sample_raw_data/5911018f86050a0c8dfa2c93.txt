May 09 2017 : The Economic Times (Mumbai) Pelosi, 7 other US MPs Head to Dharamshala to Meet Dalai Lama NEW DELHI India has al lowed US House Demo cratic leader Nancy Pelosi to travel to Dhamarsala to meet the Dalai Lama on Tuesday, days after the Tibetan Spiritual leader visited Arunachal Pradesh, drawing sharp reaction from China. Seven US Congressmen are accompanying Pelosi, a long-time supporter of the Tibetan cause. The Congressmen will be in Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, on May 9-10, a Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) spokesperson said. Besides meeting the Dalai Lama, they will meet CTA functionaries, including PM-in-exile Lobsang Sangay. Pelosi, who last visited Dharamsala in March 2008 as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, was a prime mover in the 2007 decision to honour the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal. China had then protested against the move.
